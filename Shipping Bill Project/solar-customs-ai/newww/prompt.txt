CRITICAL MAPPING RULES (HOW TO FIND VALUES)

1. FREIGHT & INSURANCE (MAPPING LOGIC):
   - GO TO SECTION: "Part II - INVOICE DETAILS" (Do not look in Part III).
   - LOCATE COLUMN: Look for the specific column headers "Freight" and "Insurance".
   - EXTRACT: The value listed in the row for the specific Invoice Number.
   - NOTE: These are Foreign Currency values. Extract them exactly as shown.

2. FOB VALUE (MAPPING LOGIC):
   - GO TO SECTION: "Part III - ITEM DETAILS".
   - LOCATE COLUMN: "9.FOB (INR)".
   - EXTRACT: The value for each specific item row.

3. LEO DATE:
   - GO TO SECTION: "J.PROCESS DETAILS" (usually last page).
   - ROW: "9.LEO".
   - EXTRACT: The Date portion only.

4. RoDTEP & DRAWBACK:
   - GO TO SECTION: "Part IV - EXPORT SCHEME DETAILS".
   - MATCHING: Match the Item Number from Part III to the Item Number in Part IV to get the correct scheme amount.

===========================================
DATA CLEANING RULES
